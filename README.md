# JUCE.cmake

`JUCE.cmake` is a collection of tools dedicated to building [JUCE][juce] projects using
[CMake][cmake] instead of the [Projucer][projucer].

It currently contains:

- `Reprojucer.cmake`, a CMake module that provides high-level functions to reproduce how a
JUCE project is defined in the Projucer,

- `Jucer2CMake`, a console application based on JUCE that converts `.jucer` project files
into `CMakeLists.txt` files,

- several `CMakeLists.txt` files to build JUCE's `examples` and `extras` projects (in
[Jucer2CMake/generated/JUCE](Jucer2CMake/generated/JUCE)).


## Requirements

- CMake, version 3.4 minimum
- JUCE, version 4.2.0 to 4.3.1 (JUCE 5 is not supported yet)


## Getting started

Let's consider that you have a copy of [JUCE][github-juce], a copy of
[JUCE.cmake][github-juce-cmake] and a JUCE project called `MyGreatProject` following this
folder structure:

```
    <root>
    ├── JUCE/
    ├── JUCE.cmake/
    └── MyGreatProject/
        ├── Source/
        └── MyGreatProject.jucer
```

We first build `Jucer2CMake` with CMake. Since `Jucer2CMake` uses the JUCE modules
`juce_core`, `juce_data_structures` and `juce_events`, we specify where to find JUCE by
defining `JUCE_ROOT` when calling `cmake`.

```sh
cd <root>/JUCE.cmake/Jucer2CMake

mkdir build && cd build

# On macOS
cmake .. -G Xcode -DJUCE_ROOT=../../../JUCE
# On Windows
cmake .. -DJUCE_ROOT=../../../JUCE

cmake --build .
```

Then we convert `MyGreatProject.jucer` to a new `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```sh
cd <root>/MyGreatProject

../JUCE.cmake/Jucer2CMake/build/Debug/Jucer2CMake MyGreatProject.jucer ../JUCE.cmake/cmake/Reprojucer.cmake
```

Now we can build `MyGreatProject` using CMake:

```sh
cd <root>/MyGreatProject

mkdir build && cd build

# On macOs
cmake .. -G Xcode -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer
# On Windows
cmake .. -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer

cmake --build .
```
