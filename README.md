# JUCE.cmake

`JUCE.cmake` is a collection of tools dedicated to building [JUCE][juce] projects using
[CMake][cmake] instead of [Projucer][projucer].

It currently contains:

- `Reprojucer.cmake`, a CMake module that provides high-level functions to reproduce how a
JUCE project is defined in Projucer,

- `Jucer2Reprojucer`, a console application based on JUCE that converts `.jucer` project
files into `CMakeLists.txt` files that include and use `Reprojucer.cmake`,

- several `CMakeLists.txt` files generated from existing `.jucer` project files,
including:
  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 4.2.0][github-juce-4.2.0] (in
[Jucer2Reprojucer/generated/JUCE-4.2.0](Jucer2Reprojucer/generated/JUCE-4.2.0))
  - `examples` and `extras` projects from [JUCE 4.3.1][github-juce-4.3.1] (in
[Jucer2Reprojucer/generated/JUCE-4.3.1](Jucer2Reprojucer/generated/JUCE-4.3.1))


## Requirements

- CMake, version 3.4 minimum
- JUCE, version 4.2.0 to 4.3.1 (JUCE 5 is not supported yet)


## Getting started

Let's consider that you have a copy of [JUCE][github-juce], a copy of
[JUCE.cmake][github-juce-cmake] and a JUCE project called `MyGreatProject` following this
folder structure:

```
    <root>
    ├── JUCE/
    ├── JUCE.cmake/
    └── MyGreatProject/
        ├── Source/
        └── MyGreatProject.jucer
```

We first build `Jucer2Reprojucer` with CMake. Since `Jucer2Reprojucer` uses the JUCE
modules `juce_core`, `juce_data_structures` and `juce_events`, we specify where to find
JUCE by defining `JUCE_ROOT` when calling `cmake`.

```sh
cd <root>/JUCE.cmake/Jucer2Reprojucer

mkdir build && cd build

# On macOS
cmake .. -G Xcode -DJUCE_ROOT=../../../JUCE
# On Linux and on Windows
cmake .. -DJUCE_ROOT=../../../JUCE

cmake --build .
```

Then we convert `MyGreatProject.jucer` to a new `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```sh
cd <root>/MyGreatProject

# On macOs and on Windows
../JUCE.cmake/Jucer2Reprojucer/build/Debug/Jucer2Reprojucer MyGreatProject.jucer ../JUCE.cmake/cmake/Reprojucer.cmake
# On Linux
../JUCE.cmake/Jucer2Reprojucer/build/Jucer2Reprojucer MyGreatProject.jucer ../JUCE.cmake/cmake/Reprojucer.cmake
```

Now we can build `MyGreatProject` using CMake:

```sh
cd <root>/MyGreatProject

mkdir build && cd build

# On macOs
cmake .. -G Xcode -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer
# On Linux and on Windows
cmake .. -DMyGreatProject_jucer_FILE=../MyGreatProject.jucer

cmake --build .
```


## Supported export targets

`Reprojucer.cmake` and `Jucer2Reprojucer` support the following Projucer export targets:
- Xcode (MacOSX)
- Visual Studio 2015
- Visual Studio 2013
- Linux Makefiles
